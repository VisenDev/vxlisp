# Syntax

## Conventions

* Spaces or Tabs - Spaces because tabs are hidden and formatting in vxlisp is intentional.
* LF, CRLF, or CR - LF (Linefeeds) are used to stick to the open standard of UNIX/Linux.
* UTF-8 or ANSI - UTF-8 is the simple standard that supports localization.
* Whitespace - Any amount of whitespace is a single delimiter except inside "" or ``
* lower-case, CamelCase, camelCase - lower-case because hyphens are more readable and vxlisp does not confuse hyphen with minus sign. camelCase is gross.

## Everything is a List

## Keywords

## Reserved words or terms

* (project), (package), (func), (type), (const), (fn), (new), (copy), (empty) are reserved functions and should not be overloaded.
