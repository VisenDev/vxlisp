FAQ
* What is the elevator pitch? - VxLisp is a proposal for a simple, new programming language/data structure that could actually fullfill the dream of 'write once, run anywhere'.

* Write once, run anywhere is a pipedream. How can it possibly work? - Most new languages try to write a platform along with the language. Instead I want to write a language that can compile to any other language or platform with identical results.

* New languages rarely work. Why write one? - To improve the art. I find most languages to have ugly, confusing syntax and poor manageability. I hope to point out that this need not be true.

* Everyone has a bias. What is yours? - I admit it. I love Functional Programming and Test driven development. I dislike Imperitive programming, and Object-oriented programming. I also dislike large corporations.

* What are your inspirations? - Obviously, Lisp. I was introduced to it in 1987 and it stuck with me. More recently: Javascript, Typescript, Scala, Clojure, Clojurescript, Elm, and an obscure XML programming language called NuXML.

* What are your first principles? - Simplify, Simplify, Simplify. Manageability > Readability > Functionality > Performance. Simplicity requires the removal of dependencies wherever possible.

* What are the key features of the language? - Open Source. Compact consistent syntax. Interoperable with native code. All-in-one: code, test, documentation. Everything is the same data structure. Test cases in documentation. Simplified handling of many of the most ugly coding patterns including generics, exceptions, null, inheritence, asynchronous code, constructors, immutability, thread-safety, and overloading.

* Are there any unusual features of the language? - Built in Webserver, Documentation builder, Test suite, Test coverage. BigO coverage. Simplified generic handling. Simplified asynchronous programming, Simplified error handling. Simplified context management. Simplified multiple inheritence. Functions are first class objects. Simple access to type data. Universal serialization/deserialization. Memory Pooling. State Management. File parsing. Repl. Few restricted characters. Free use of whitespace. Option to write code from documentation. Potential to easily write code to unusual platforms like Html Canvas or WebAssembly. Potential to simultaneously write native android and IOS without middleware like react native.
